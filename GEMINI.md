# Project Overview

This repository contains the **HADIS (Holistic Automated Disaster Intelligence System)**, a modular, cloud-native pipeline for automated flood monitoring. The system is designed to automate the retrieval of satellite imagery (SAR/Optical), perform AI-based flood extent and depth estimation, and output risk assessment matrices.

The project is defined by a detailed `software_requirements_specification.md` which outlines the functional and non-functional requirements. The core of the project involves data processing and analysis using Python, likely with libraries for geospatial analysis like Google Earth Engine and Xarray, as suggested by the Jupyter Notebooks in the `demos` directory.

# Building and Running

**TODO:** The build and execution commands for this project are not yet defined. Based on the `software_requirements_specification.md`, the project will have a Command Line Interface (CLI) for batch processing.

# Development Conventions

**TODO:** Development conventions, including coding style, testing practices, and contribution guidelines, are not yet documented.
